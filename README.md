Abstract
	The application of established cell viability assays to coral cells is not straightforward due to different culture parameters and different cellular features specific to mammalian cells compared to marine invertebrates. Issues related to the commonly used trypan blue staining method have been documented (binds to free enzymes in culture medium). Using _Pocillopora damicornis_ as a model, we characterized the autofluorescence and tested different fluorescent dye pair combinations to identify alternative viability indicators. As a proof-of-concept, the cytotoxicity of titanium oxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) and insulin was measured after 24 hours of exposure using the fluorescent dye pair Hoechst 33342 and SYTOX® orange. Our results show that this dye pair can be distinctly measured in the presence of fluorescent proteins plus chlorophyll. _P. damicornis_ cells exposed for 24 hours to concentrations of TiO2 NPs or insulin between 0.5-100 µg/mL revealed a LC50 of 20 µg/mL for TiO2 NPs and an average 20% reduction in viability at 100 µg/mL for insulin. The workflow presented here provides a framework for customizing dye pairs considering the species- and genotype-specific autofluorescence of scleractinian corals.
